# My Arch Linux rice
This is and will always be WIP.  
The default configuration files are made for a hidpi setup with some system specific settings.  
There are however multiple patches available (e.g. for 1080p compatibility).

### default system specific settings include (not limited to)
- hidpi
- eu keyboard layout
- single screen connected on eDP1

### Instructions
1. Backup your existing config files. They will be overwritten!
2. `git clone https://github.com/JohnnyVim/arch-rice.git`
3. Read the files before syncing!
4. `./arch-rice/scripts/sync.sh`
5. apply necessary patches (e.g. for 1080p `./arch-rice/scripts/patch_1080p.sh`)
6. adjust settings specific to your system
7. install the packages you want/need
8. Tip: You can create your own patch files to make future updating much easier.

### Packages used (incomplete)

- community
  - compton
- AUR
  - enpass-bin
